Note: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

In this article I’m going to mention what I personally view as red hot cryptocurrencies, altcoins and NFTs for people to invest in to secure their financial future for many years to come! If you think Shiba Inu was big then you need to pay closer attention to the following investment tips to increase your digital crypto wallet portfolios.

Some of the following cryptocurrencies, altcoins and NFTs will create a profitable cryptocurrency portfolio before the end of the year 2021 and secure your cryptocurrency investment portfolio for 2022 and beyond! 

Before we go any further I strongly recommend you do your own research into the cryptocurrencies, altcoins and NFTs I mention in this crypto news article as I may miss something or things could change in the time since I published this article and as I mentioned before I’m not a financial advisor, I’m just your crypto guy in the know! With that in mind I will have options at the bottom of this crypto news article for you to connect with me on my social information platforms!

So without any further delay I will get into the juicy details for you to read and take action today to secure you and your families financial future in the digital cryptocurrency space.

The following is information I gathered from the crypto market place as of Thursday 28th of October 2021 and I recommend you check the information for yourself before buying any of the following cryptos, altcoins or NFTs as things can change for many reasons out of our own control.

The first coins I’m very excited about have had plenty of movement of late with plenty more movement in an upward trend (bull run) predicted by the end of the year 2021 and well into next year and beyond. I will also be publishing a follow up article explaining more in depth about what these coins represent and how the projects behind them will benefit us in the future.

Kleekai trading as (KLEE) was up 77% in 24 hours and up 13.8% in 1 hour with a bull run expected to continue. Buy and hold this altcoin to see good profits by the end of the year 2021.

Aidi Inu trading as (AIDI) was up 60.7% in 24 hours and up 7.9% in 1 hour and a bull run is also expected with this coin until the end of 2021 atleast. Buy and hold this altcoin to increase your crypto portfolio today.

Kuma Inu trading as (KUMA) was up 25.3% in 24 hours and up 2% in 1 hour another big bull run is predicted for Kuma Inu by some crypto experts from around the world! Now as I looked on the morning of Friday 29th October the Kuma Inu coin had taken a slight dip in the market but this wouldn’t concern me in the slightest and is infact great news for new investors in this altcoin!

My next recommendation is possible one of the strongest cryptocurrency investments of this year and next year! The altcoin I’m very bullish about is the Enjin coin trading as (ENJ) and availble to trade on almost every crypto exchange out there which is also a strong positive for the Enjin coin. I recommend you do your research into what this altcoin is all about so you to will understand why so many of us in the crypto investing space are so excited about the Enjin coin and the projects behind the coin. This power house of an altcoin is very cheap at present and a very strong contender for your end of year banker investment!!! The Enjin coin is up 11% in 24 hours and 0.8% in 1 hour with massive gains predicted over the coming weeks, months and even years.

Next on my list of red hot coins is Safemoon Inu which is linked to the Enjin coin and both of these are linked to the Safemoon coin which has had massive gains over the past few days but I’m not going to go into these coins in this article as I plan on doing a future article about Safemoon, Safemoon Inu and Enjin coin but in the meantime you can do your own research into the Safemoon projects so you can take action now to buy these red hot cryptos.

Now for one of the biggest NFTs in the marketplace to get your investing off to a flying start! 

The Superbid NFT is the first celebrity moments NFT marketplace with a very exciting future ahead. The idea behind the Superbid NFT is for celebrity fans and followers to discover, collect and trade unique moments from their favourite celebrities, immortalized on blockchain technology. Buy and hold the Superbid NFT and reap the future rewards for your very wise decisions!
